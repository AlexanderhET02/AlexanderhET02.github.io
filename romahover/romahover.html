                <p>The Pantheon in Rome is one of the best-preserved monuments of ancient Rome, originally built around 25 B.C. by Marcus Agrippa and later reconstructed by Emperor Hadrian between 126-128 A.D.. Originally a temple dedicated to all Roman gods, its name derives from the Greek words pan (all) and theos (gods). The structure is renowned for its massive domed ceiling, which was the largest of its kind when built and remains the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome. The oculus, a central opening in the dome, allows natural light to illuminate the interior. Over time, the Pantheon transitioned from a pagan temple to a Christian church in 609 A.D., ensuring its preservation through centuries. Today, it stands as a major tourist attraction, influencing architectural designs worldwide and serving as a testament to Roman engineering brilliance </p>

                    The Roman Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is an iconic structure built between 70-80 AD under Emperor Vespasian and completed by his son Titus. As the largest amphitheater ever constructed, it could hold between 50,000 to 80,000 spectators and was primarily used for gladiatorial contests, animal hunts, executions, and mock naval battles. Made of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and concrete, it featured an advanced tiered seating system reflecting Roman social hierarchy. After the fall of the empire, it was repurposed as a fortress, quarry, and Christian shrine, leading to its gradual deterioration. Despite this, it remains a symbol of Imperial Rome, with restoration efforts preserving its legacy. Today, as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World, it attracts millions of visitors annually and hosts a torchlit ‚ÄúWay of the Cross‚Äù procession every Good Friday, symbolizing its continued cultural and historical significance.

                <p>The Teatro di Marcello, or Theatre of Marcellus, is an ancient open-air theater in Rome, Italy, built during the late Roman Republic. Originally conceived by Julius Caesar, construction was completed in 13 BC under Emperor Augustus, who dedicated it to his late nephew Marcus Claudius Marcellus. As the largest and most important theater in Ancient Rome, it could accommodate between 11,000 and 20,000 spectators and was constructed using tuff, concrete, and travertine stone. The theater featured three levels of arches, with Doric columns on the lower tier, Ionic in the middle, and possibly Corinthian on the upper level. Over time, it fell into disuse and was repurposed as a fortress in the medieval period before being transformed into the Palazzo Savelli-Orsini in the 16th century. Today, its lower levels remain visible, showcasing its Roman architectural influence, while the upper sections serve as private residences </p>
